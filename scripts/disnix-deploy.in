Usage: $0 [OPTION] MANIFEST
  or: $0 --rollback [OPTION]
  or: $0 --switch-generation NUM [OPTION]

The command \`disnix-deploy' is used to install, upgrade, or roll back a
service-oriented system in a given environment from a prebuilt Disnix
configuration (a manifest file), that has been built with \`disnix-manifest'.

A deployment process consists of the following activities: first it copies the
intra-dependency closures of the services to the target machines in the network.
Finally, the services are activated by traversing the inter-dependency graph of
all the services.

In case of a failure, a rollback is performed to bring the system back in its
previous configuration.

If there is already a distributed system configuration deployed, an upgrade is
performed. In this phase only the changed parts of the system are deactivated
and activated. In this process we also deal with the inter-dependencies so that
no services fails due to a missing inter-dependency.

If state deployment has been enabled for a service and that particular service
has been moved from one machine to another, then a snapshot of the state is
taken, transferred to the new machine, and finally restored.

Most users don't need to use this command directly. The \`disnix-env' command
will automatically invoke this command to activate the new configuration.

Options:
      -o, --old-manifest=MANIFEST Nix profile path where the manifest should be
                                  stored, so that Disnix knows the current
                                  configuration of a distributed system. By
                                  default it is stored in the profile directory
                                  of the user.
      --target-property=PROP      The target property of an infrastructure
                                  model, that specifies how to connect to the
                                  remote Disnix interface. (Defaults to
                                  hostname)
      --deploy-state              Indicates whether to globally deploy state
                                  (disabled by default)
  -p, --profile=PROFILE           Name of the profile that is used for this
                                  system. Defaults to: default
  -m, --max-concurrent-transfers=NUM
                                  Maximum amount of concurrent closure
                                  transfers. Defauls to: 2
      --coordinator-profile-path=PATH
                                  Path where to store the coordinator profile
                                  generations
      --no-upgrade                Do not perform an upgrade, but activate all
                                  services of the new configuration
      --no-lock                   Do not attempt to acquire and release any
                                  locks
      --no-coordinator-profile    Specifies that the coordinator profile should
                                  not be updated
      --no-target-profiles        Specifies that the target profiles should not
                                  be updated
      --no-migration              Do not migrate the state of services from one
                                  machine to another, even if they have been
                                  annotated as such
      --no-delete-state           Do not remove the state of deactivated services
      --show-trace                Shows a trace of the output
  -h, --help                      Shows the usage of this command
  -v, --version                   Shows the version of this command

Environment:
  DISNIX_PROFILE             Sets the name of the profile that stores the
                             manifest on the coordinator machine and the
                             deployed services per machine on each target
                             (Defaults to: default).
  DISNIX_DEPLOY_STATE        If set to 1 it also deploys the state of all
                             components. (defaults to: 0)
  DISNIX_NO_DELETE_STATE     If set to 1 it does not delete the obsolete state
                             after upgrading. (defaults to: 0)
  DYSNOMIA_STATEDIR          Specifies where the snapshots must be stored on the
                             coordinator machine (defaults to:
                             /var/state/dysnomia)
