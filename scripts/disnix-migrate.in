Usage: $0 [OPTION] MANIFEST

The command \`disnix-migrate' is used to snapshot, transfer and restore the
state of services that have been moved from one machine to another.

Most users don't need to use this command directly. The \`disnix-env' command
will automatically invoke this command to activate the new configuration.

Options:
  -o, --old-manifest=MANIFEST     Nix profile path where the manifest should be
                                  stored, so that Disnix knows the current
                                  configuration of a distributed system. By
                                  default it is stored in the profile directory
                                  of the user.
  -p, --profile=PROFILE           Name of the profile that is used for this
                                  system. Defaults to: default
  -m, --max-concurrent-transfers=NUM
                                  Maximum amount of concurrent closure
                                  transfers. Defauls to: 2
      --coordinator-profile-path=PATH
                                  Path where to store the coordinator profile
                                  generations
      --no-upgrade                Do not perform an upgrade, but activate all
                                  services of the new configuration
      --delete-state              Remove the obsolete state of deactivated
                                  services
      --depth-first               Snapshots components depth-first as opposed to
                                  breadth-first. This approach is more space
                                  efficient, but slower.
      --keep=NUM                  Amount of snapshot generations to keep.
                                  Defaults to: 1
  -h, --help                      Shows the usage of this command
  -v, --version                   Shows the version of this command

Environment:
  DISNIX_PROFILE             Sets the name of the profile that stores the
                             manifest on the coordinator machine and the
                             deployed services per machine on each target
                             (Defaults to: default).
  DISNIX_DELETE_STATE        If set to 1 it automatically deletes the obsolete
                             state after upgrading. (defaults to: 0)
  DYSNOMIA_STATEDIR          Specifies where the snapshots must be stored on the
                             coordinator machine (defaults to:
                             /var/state/dysnomia)
