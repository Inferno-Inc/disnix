Usage: $0 -s services_nix -i infrastructure_nix -d distribution_nix [OPTION]
  or: $0 -A architecture_nix [OPTION]

The command \`disnix-delegate' is used to instantiate all derivations of the
services deployed machines in the network and to delegate their build operations
to the target machines.

This command requires three Nix expressions as input parameters -- a services
model capturing the components of a distributed system and its
inter-dependencies, an infrastructure model capturing the machines in the
network and its properties and a distribution model which maps services to
machines.

Most users don't need to use this command directly. The \`disnix-env' command
will automatically invoke this command to activate the new configuration.

Options:
  -s, --services=services_nix
                                  Services Nix expression which describes all
                                  components of the distributed system
  -i, --infrastructure=infrastructure_nix
                                  Infrastructure Nix expression which captures
                                  properties of machines in the network
  -d, --distribution=distribution_nix
                                  Distribution Nix expression which maps
                                  services to machines in the network
  -P, --packages=packages_nix
                                  Packages Nix expression specifying the packages
                                  that should be deployed in a Nix profile mapped
                                  to each machine in the network
  -A, --architecture=architecture_nix
                                  Deployment architecture Nix expression that
                                  captures all properties of the services and
                                  infrastructure including the distribution of
                                  services to targets
      --target-property=PROP      The target property of an infrastructure
                                  model, that specifies how to connect to the
                                  remote Disnix interface. (Defaults to
                                  hostname)
      --interface=INTERFACE       Path to executable that communicates with a
                                  Disnix interface. Defaults to:
                                  disnix-ssh-client
  -m, --max-concurrent-transfers=NUM
                                  Maximum amount of concurrent closure
                                  transfers. Defauls to: 2
      --show-trace                Shows a trace of the output
  -h, --help                      Shows the usage of this command
  -v, --version                   Shows the version of this command

Environment:
  DISNIX_CLIENT_INTERFACE    Sets the client interface (defaults to:
                             disnix-ssh-client)
  DISNIX_TARGET_PROPERTY     Sets the target property of an infrastructure
                             model, that specifies how to connect to the remote
                             Disnix interface. (Defaults to: hostname)
