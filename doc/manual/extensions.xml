	<title>Extensions</title>

        <para>
		Although Disnix makes the deployment of a distributed system more convenient and
		offers features to make this process reiable and efficient, some extensions have been
		developed to make this process more convenient.

		<title>DisnixWebService</title> 
		
		<para>
			In some cases other communication protocols are desired to use in order to
			connect to remote machines, except SSH. The <code>DisnixWebService</code>
			is a package that contains a SOAP interface for deployment operations and
			a <command>disnix-soap-client</command> utility to connect to it.

		<title>DisnixOS</title>
		
		<para>
			Although Disnix manages the distributable components (services) of which a
			distributed system is composed and the inter-dependencies, Disnix does
			not manage the system configurations of the actual machines on which services are activated.
			NixOS provides the command <command>nixos-deploy-network</command> to manage
			a network of NixOS configurations.
			This package conbines the Disnix tooling and NixOS tooling to manage distributed
			system components <emphasis>and</emphasis> the underlying infrastructure based on
			<link xlink:href="http://nixos.org/nixos">NixOS</link>
			system configurations, and an extension to automatically
			create virtual machine instances from the network configuration for testing.
