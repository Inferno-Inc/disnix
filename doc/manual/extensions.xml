		<para>
			In some cases other communication protocols are desired to use in order to
			connect to remote machines, except SSH. The <code>DisnixWebService</code>
			is a package that contains a SOAP interface for deployment operations and
			the <command>disnix-soap-client</command> to connect to it.

		<title>NixOS integration</title>
		
		<para>
			Although Disnix manages the distributable components (services) of which a
			distributed system is composed and the inter-dependencies, Disnix does
			not manage the systtem configurations of the actual machines on which services are activated.
			This package contains additional tooling to manage
			<link xlink:href="http://nixos.org/nixos">NixOS</link>
			system configurations of the machines in the network, and an extension to automatically
			create virtual machine instances from the network configuration for testing.
