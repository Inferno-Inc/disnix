.SH DESCRIPTION
The command \fBdisnix\-copy\-closure\fR copies a Nix store component and all its intra-dependencies
to or from a given target machine through a Disnix interface. This process is very efficient, since
it scans for all intra-dependencies and only copies the missing parts.
.PP
This command is very similar to the \fBnix\-copy\-closure\fR command, except that it uses a Disnix interface
for transport (which optionally uses SSH or a custom protocol) instead of using SSH directly.
