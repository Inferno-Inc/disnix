.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disnix\-build
[--interface interface] distributed_derivation
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command \fBdisnix\-build\fR builds derivations on the given target machines specified in a distributed derivation
XML file. When the building process is complete, the results are transfered back to the coordinator machine,
so that they are kept for further use and do not have to be rebuilt again in case of a configuration change.

command if the \fB\-\-build-on-targets\fR is specified.
